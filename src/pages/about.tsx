    <p> Hi, this is Qi Shu. I'm currently a third-year student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing a Computer
      Science and Business Administration Double Degree.
      I love programming to solve problems, especially tackling issues which I might encouter in our daily lives. I'm
      also interested in finance-related fields; I have always been
      passionate about stock markets, and I hope I could have an opportunity to get in touch with it in the future.
      :)
    </p>

    <p>
      I worked as a web developer this winter at Ontario Investment Office, and was a research assistant in school
      this summer in charge of developing a web application to compare people's
      working efficiency, and analyzing data with NumPy. I will be starting another research
      assistantship this fall, compiling DBMS that has a simple extensible runtime and operates
      by translating SQL-like datamanipulation requests directly to C code that interfaces with
      this runtime
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I hope that I would have opportunities to work in different fields, be it in tech or finance, and explore
      different companies' culture, and find where my true passion lies eventually.
    </p>
